# MedReSyst - Learning Coalitions

Welcome to MedReSyst - Learning Coalitions ! This webpage gathers the codes, projects and packages made by the contributors at UCLouvain. Most projects are centered around the development of multi-modal IA and learning coalitions tools.

## Context

Advances in network and systems medicine and AI have enabled the development of new  predictors for diagnosis and treatment planning based on high-quality multimodal high-quality multimodal medical and clinical data collected and annotated in leading teaching hospitals and academic centers. Yet, the challenge persists in applying these advancements to real clinical settings, where data quality and expertise vary widely.

Introducing Learning Coalitions, a method fostering collaboration among diverse hospitals. This approach ensures consistent decision-making by uniting these entities under shared care protocols, enabling continuous improvement of learning models.

Through collective efforts, each hospital actively contributes to refining clinical decisions, harmonizing the quality of care across the coalition. This collaborative synergy not only enhances medical outcomes but also bridges the gap between teaching and non-teaching hospitals, fostering expertise alignment and reducing discrepancies. Experience a new era of healthcare, where collaboration drives progress and improves patient outcomes for all.
